## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2017 to 2019 in order to better understand:

1. What programming languages are on the rise during the previous three years?
2. How does the education level affects the salary, job and career satisfaction?
3. Does the number of people who desire to work in a particular language accurately predicts its rise in the following year?
4. What does the developers in general think of higher management?



## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

The repository contains 4 individual notebooks, each answering the above mentioned questions. They contain exploratory data analysis with a separate notebook for predicting salary.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@nouman10/insights-from-stackoverflows-data-from-the-last-three-years-ea50bba90736).
